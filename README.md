# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Description of Project**

This project is to build a responsive webpage that has a header, profile, gallery of images, and footer. The webpage should match the Figma specs for Desktop and mobile, along with any breakpoints that we deem appropriate.

This project has been updated to include JavaScript functionality including opening and closing a profile edit window and changing the name and description of the profile. Additinally, a template has been used to build the cards so future funcitonality will allow users to add cards.

**Description of Techniques**

This is a chance to practice using flexbox and grid displays and positioning elements for different display sizes. While the gallery of images is responsive due to grid and grid-template-columns with auto-fit, media queries were used to make breakpoints at 480px and 785px. Flexbox was used for the profile elements and changing to flex-direction: columns at lower screen sizes allowed a reorganization of the profile elements so they stacked on top of each other.

Vanilla JS has been used to add functionality including opening and closing profile edit boxes and changing the name and description in the profile. A template card has been used to allow rendering of cards from an array of objects.

**To Improve**

I would like to make a smoother transition for the breakpoint at 785px since I transitioned from grid to flexbox for the profile element and the transition is pretty jarring.
